Regression is techinique in supervised learning where we predict the
continuous data

Regression is supervised learning technique where the target variable 
is continuous in nature

It is a processing for establishing a relationship between
x & y,

LinearRegression
It is a processing for establishing a relationship between
x & y, and when the relationship is linear in nature , we call it as
linearregression



Explain LinearRegression
def -: is a process of establishing relationship between your dependent variable
and independent variable, and when the relationship is linear in nature we call it as linear regression

goal-: is to create a best-fit line by using the formula
Y = MX + C
	where, 
		Y is dependent variable
		X is independent variable
		M is slope/ gradient/ weight/ Coefficient of Regression
		C is intercept(point where line touches at Yaxis)


objective -:
	1. is to establish the relationship between x & y
	2. is to forecaste new observations

adv -: is very easy to interpret

disadv -: highly affected by outliers, missing values & skewness

performance -: we use MAE,MSE, RMSE evaluation of error in model
		we use R2 score to evaluate how good the model is performing

Optimization -:




Error is difference between the actual value & Predicted Values


|3-2.8| + |4-3.3| + |2-3.6| + |4-4| + |5-4.4| / 5 =>mae 

(3-2.8)**2 + (4-3.3)**2 + (2-3.6)**2 + (4-4)**2 + (5-4.4)**2 / 5 =>mse
